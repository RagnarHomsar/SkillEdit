# SkillEdit
An editor for the Etrian Odyssey III skill tables, and the skill name tables too. It probably works with the later games if you change some stuff in the code. It probably won't work out of the box with EO4 due to the weird skill levels in that game.

# Known Issues
* Apply Changes only tracks the currently-selected subheader. I really don't care about fixing this right now.
* There's no indication of if you're about to lose unsaved work. Again, eh.
